# Source Checker
[![Program Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.0.0-blue)](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Source-Checker) 

Source Checker is a program coded in C# to check if a source code might be infected. You can use this checker for any projects, but it was mainly coded for checking <b>Minecraft Cheating Clients source code</b>.

***This tool is not 100% accurate, the tool only checks if there are suspicious keywords in a file. Checking the files manually is always better.***

I do not take any responsibilities if you got infected by a malware after checking the files with this tool.
